            <p>Trevor is a career criminal and former bank robber with a complicated past, who later 
                founded his own company, Trevor Philips Enterprises, operating with drug dealing and weapon 
                smuggling in Blaine County. He is friends with Ron Jakowski and Wade Hebert, who work for his company, 
                as well as the oldest and best friend of Michael, whom he believed to be dead for almost a decade after 
                he faked his death to retire from the criminal life.</p>

            <p>Trevor is known to have a generally reckless and very aggressive behavior, but he is also very 
                loyal and deeply respects all those close to him. Trevor's story focuses on how his actions have consequences 
                on both himself and his friends, and him coming to terms with Michael's past actions. Trevor later also 
                befriends the third protagonist, Franklin, becoming somewhat of a mentor figure to him.</p>
